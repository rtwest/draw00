----------------------------------
Other client side needs
- is this first time sign in? - If yes, first time experience - FIRST TIME KEYPAIR FLAG
- what mode is this in - admin or client or unknown? - go to admin signin, client register, or mode selection screen.  Look for USER ARRAY
- do i have user details? SINGLE USER ARRAY (usertype, name, parent_id, email ..other_as_needed..)
	- admin details (name, parent_id, reqs FB registration?) - if not, show FB sign in
	- client details (name, kid_id) - if not, show client code input
- for client, list of friends (name, kid_id) - FRIENDS ARRAY
- for admin, list of clients (name, kid_id) - CLIENT ARRAY

CREATING A NEW INVITATION
1. enter parent email and lookup to verify
2. enter the kids display name and lookup to verify
3. default to the display of the kid whose context you're creating the invitation in
4. create new invitation record with the 4 corresponding IDs


 REGISTERING THE CLIENT DEVICE WITH PARENT DEVICE
 - On Parent device, create kid record with Display_Name. This creates a record with a generated Registration_Code and Status of "pending"
 - On Client device, after splash screen, enter kid Display_Name and matching Registration_Code.  When verified, change Status




 TO DO
-----------------------------
- Need to think through start up login and checking registration from App.JS on startup
-- What is need for local DB? - Mode, UserRegistration_ID, UserName, -- gallery stuff --
- Need to check for web connection on load and alert
- Need to restrict permissions on azure tables to authenticate users for admin and client(probably)
